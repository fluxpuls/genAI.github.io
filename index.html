    <h2>AI Innovation</h2>
    <p>One of the significant challenges we face today is the mismatch between traditional energy infrastructure and the growing demands of AI data centers. This leads to energy struggles, inefficiencies, and environmental concerns.</p>
    <p>However, everything in the universe is energy, and there are already more intelligent solutions beyond traditional methods. Innovations such as space-based solar energy offer a promising future for harnessing abundant energy safely and sustainably.</p>
    <p>In our spare time, we are dedicated to raising awareness about these non-traditional solutions. By doing so, we can ensure that the future of AI is both technologically advanced and environmentally responsible. By thinking outside the box, we can create a future where AI and energy infrastructure coexist harmoniously.</p>
